    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials </h2>
        <p> In part 1, I implemented the BSDF for mirror and glass materials. For the mirror model,
        we simply reflect the wo across the z axis by negating its x and y values. We set the pdf to 1
        and return the reflectance (modified according to the spec). I also implemented a refract method,
        which handles the case where light passes through a material. To find the refraction angle wi,
        I used the formulas derived from Snell's equation. Note that I used the z axis direction to find
        whether the light ray was entering or exiting the material and thus, the corresponding index of
        refraction. Finally, I implemented the glass BSDF model which both reflects and refracts light.
        To model this in my program, I used Schlick's approximation to decide whether to reflect or refract
        a certain light ray.</p>

        <p> Shown below are seven images of CBspheres.dae rendered with varying ray depths (with
        64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light).

        <p> As with last project, depth 0 retains the empty black scene with only the light source
        displayed. This is because there are no bounces and only the area light rays reach the camera.
        </p>

        <p> With 1 bounce, the room lights up along with a small part of the
            spheres that reflect light towards the camera. Since, there is one bounce,
            the light rays can bounce off of the walls and floor and then hit the camera.
        </p>

        <p> With 2 bounces, the ceiling lights up along with the reflective components (excluding
            the reflected light source that appeared at one bounce) of the spheres.
            For the ceiling, this shows up on two bounces (and not 1) because it is on the same plane
            as the light source, so the first bounce cannot be there. It needs to bounce off of the side
            walls first, and then the ceiling and then finally the camera. The reflective component
            shown on the spheres needs two bounces to show up, ie it bounces off the wall, and then is reflected
            off the sphere, and then hits the camera. Notice that the ceiling reflection does not yet show up
            because the light rays cannot bounce off the ceiling on the first bounce. The black "wall" in the center
            of the spheres will actually never show up even with more bounces, because there is no
            wall to reflect the initial light rays (this is the camera viewing point). Lastly, notice that
            the right ball (which is glass) is much darker because some light rays are refracted into the sphere
            and don't show up yet.
        </p>

        <p>
            With 3 bounces, the refracted component of the glass sphere on the right starts to appear.
            This is because it needs to bounce off the wall (1), refract entering the sphere (2), and refract
            exiting the sphere (3), before hitting the camera. This causes the glass ball to become much brighter
            as all the light rays "lost" with two bounces start to show up. Some smaller details the ceiling
            and the reflective component of the glass ball start to show up on the mirror ball on the left.
            This is intuitively because these both lit up in the actual scene at two bounces. We thus have an additional
            third bounce for it to bounce off the mirror and into the camera to display these two. More specifically
            the light rays bounce off the wall (1), bounce off the ceiling / reflect off the glass sphere (2), and then
            reflect off the mirror ball (3).
        </p>

        <p>
            With 4 bounces, we see the refractive component of the glass ball show up on the mirror ball.
            This is because the light rays are able to bounce off the wall (1), refract entering the glass sphere (2),
            refract exiting the glass sphere (3), and finally reflect off the mirror ball (4) before hitting the camera.
        </p>

        <p>
            With 5 bounces and 100 bounces, nothing else really changes except the scenes get slightly
            brighter.
        </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Materials </h2>
<p> In part 2, I implemented the BSDF for microfacet materials, which reflect light in an intricate way.
    For most of this section, I simply followed the respective formulas provided on the spec. For the overall
    BSDF function we multiply the Fresnel term, Shadowing-masking term, and the Normal distribution function, and then
    divide by 4 times the z coord of the wo and wi angles. For the normal distribution function, I used the Beckmann
    distribution as specified by the spec taking in the half vector of the ingoing and outgoing angles.
    I then calculated the Fresnel term using the refractive index (eta) and extinction coefficient
    (k) at fixed wavelengths according to the provided formula. Lastly, to reduce the noise in the rendered
    images, I implemented importance sampling which samples our BSDF with regard to our Beckman normal distribution
    function.

</p>

<p> Shown below are 4 images of CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae rendered with differing alpha values
    (128 samples per pixel, 1 sample per light, and a max ray depth of 5). In general, as
    the alpha value increases, the dragon tends to look less metallic and shiny.
    Furthermore, with alpha values of .005 and .05, the dragon has black dark spots. This in general is
    because the lower alpha values means the material is less bumpy, meaning that the sampled light rays
    bounce off cleanly off the dragon. However, as the alpha values increase (.25 and .5),
    the dragon looks more rough and the dragon becomes more colored losing any of the
    previous black spots. This is because with the more bumpy surface, light rays bounce
    in between creases in the dragon, which causes the initial black spots
    on the dragon where the area light doesn't directly hit to gain color.
