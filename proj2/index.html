    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p> In this project, I implemented a basic mesh editor! It was really cool because it is basically
    a simple version of programs I've used before such as Maya.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p> Casteljau's algorithm is used to form Bezier curves with a set of points. The algorithm basically
    performs n - 1 lerps on adjacent points to recursively create new sets of points until there is a single
    point left. This ends up as a final point on the Bezier curve. Now simply perform this for the interpolation
    constant t varying from 0 to 1, and you get the final curve. I implemented a function that
    performs the lerps on a set of arbitrary n points with a certain value t for one step. It simply consist of
    a for loop that takes the lerps between adjacent points in a c++ vector. Recursively calling this and varying
    t results in the desired curve. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    <p> Casteljau's algorithms extends to Bezier surfaces by simply repeated the algorithm for the extra dimension.
    Put simply, we first evaluate a series of Bezier curves as in part 1. However, we then use a set of points
    on these new Bezier curves to create another set of Bezier curves along the 3rd dimension. Repeating this
    step along all points along the original curves results in the desired Bezier surface. To implement this,
    we simply had the same algorithm as in Part 1 for each step (but with 3D points), along with an extra for loop
    that took a vector of points returned from taking the Bezier points from the 1D algorithm, and again applied
    the Casteljau's algorithm on these points. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    <p> To implement vertex normals, I simply looped through all the faces adjacent to a vertex using the
    provided code to traverse through half edges. For each face, I added its normal (provided function)
      to a 3D vector. Finally, I normalized it to get the final normal. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    <p> To implement the edge flip operation, I followed the recommended guideline to reassign any affected
    mesh element. To do this, I first used the reference picture provided on the spec and labeled all half edges,
    faces, vertices, and edges (half edges and edges labeled by their corresponding vertices, vertices the letter
    of shown on the picture, and faces final position they would be placed at). I then wrote down which mesh
    elements corresponded with which half edges, and which half edges corresponded with each mesh element.
    Finally, I then set in code whatever I wrote down previously. If it didn't work the first time for debugging,
      I simply deleted the code a rewrote it. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    <p> To implement the edge split operation, I (similarly to part 4) followed the recommended guideline to reassign any affected
    mesh element. To do this, I first used the reference picture provided on the spec and labeled all half edges,
    faces, vertices, and edges (half edges and edges labeled by their corresponding vertices, vertices the letter
    of shown on the picture, and faces final position they would be placed at). I then noted down which additional
    mesh elements needed to be created and did so with the same naming scheme. I then wrote down which mesh
    elements corresponded with which half edges, and which half edges corresponded with each mesh element.
    Finally, I then set in code whatever I wrote down previously. If it didn't work the first time for debugging,
      I simply deleted the code a rewrote it. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

    <p> To implement loop subdivision, I followed the template code comments. First I computed the new positions
    of all the old vertices using the provided formulas and set the new position fields to that (along with the
    marker that they were old vertices). Then I did the same for edges (edges storing the new position of the edge
    split new vertex). Then, for every edge in the original mesh, I split it using my previously defined
    method, setting each vertex's new position to the one stored by the edge and also setting the two new edges
    created to be new. I then looped through all edges, and for every new edges connected to a
      new and old vertex, I flipped them. Finally, I updated all vertices positions to their new positions. </p>


    <p> For debugging, I just ended up talking about the implementation to myself and then realizing
      my code didn't make any sense after a bit of contemplation. Afterwards, I would make
      some changes and eventually it worked! :) </p>

    <p> Meshes after loop subdivision tend to end up way more smooth. This is because the sharp edges and corners
      get averaged out and thus "smoothed" over. You can reduce this effect by pre-splitting edges around these
      sharp edges and/or corners. This causes the sharp edges and/or corners to carry much more weight, so when
      we perform loop subdivision, they are already pretty defined in those areas and don't have as drastic of
      a change.

    <p> When performing loop subdivision on the original cube shown below, we notice that
    it becomes asymmetrical. This is because while the cube itself is symmetrical, its mesh elements (notably
    its edges, are not). Since these original mesh elements act as the main focal "backbone" points in the
    algorithm, and the edges are not symmetrical, this leads to the asymmetrical loop subdivision. </p>

    <p> If we preprocess the cube by splitting each edge of the cube into 4 edges creating a more symmetrical
    collection of mesh elements, we can see that the resulting loop subdivision is much more symmetrical.
    Preprocessing helps by making the mesh elements better represent the core shape and symmetrical
      nature of the cube. See results below. </p>
